# RaveUpRace

RaveUpRace is an exciting open-source project, dedicated to providing real-time data and in-depth visualizations for motorsport enthusiasts. With the goal of creating an application for data visualization and real-time notifications, RaveUpRace is the starting point for racing fans who want to stay updated on the latest Formula 1 races.

## Introduction

The RaveUpRace project was created with the idea of providing a comprehensive experience for racing fans. By using the FastF1 API and processing data in Python, we aim to collect real-time data from Formula 1 circuits around the world. This data will then be displayed in a Flutter application that allows users to access information on ongoing races, past races, and receive real-time notifications.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-time Data Collection

-   Use the FastF1 python library to obtain real-time data from Formula 1 circuits.
-   Monitor lap times, driver positions, weather conditions, and much more.

### 2. Detailed Visualizations

-   Display detailed race information, including session results, driver and constructor standings.
-   Interactive graphs and maps for in-depth data analysis.

### 3. Real-time Notifications

-   Receive real-time push notifications for key events during races.
-   Customize notifications for favorite drivers or teams.

### 4. Artificial Intelligence for Q&A

A future dream of RaveUpRace is to develop an artificial intelligence capable of answering user questions about Formula 1.
Provide quick and accurate answers to questions like "What is the lap record at the Monza circuit?" or "Who is the driver with the most Formula 1 wins?"

### 5. Self-Hostable with Docker

RaveUpRace is designed to be versatile and easy to deploy, and one of the key advantages is its self-hosting capability using Docker. This means you can set up your own instance of RaveUpRace on your preferred server or environment effortlessly
